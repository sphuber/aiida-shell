Installation
============

The recommended method of installation is through the package manager `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install aiida-shell

To use ``aiida-shell``, a configured AiiDA profile is required.
The ``verdi`` CLI of AiiDA provides a command that attempts to automatically create one:

.. code-block:: console

    verdi quicksetup

Please refer to the `AiiDA's documentation <https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/latest/intro/get_started.html>`_ for more detailed instructions.
